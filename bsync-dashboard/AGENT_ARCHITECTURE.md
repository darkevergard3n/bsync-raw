# Agent Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The SyncTool system uses a two-binary architecture where the SyncTool Agent acts as a management layer on top of the Syncthing binary. This design provides centralized management capabilities while leveraging Syncthing's proven synchronization engine.

## Architecture Components

### 1. SyncTool Agent (~21MB)
The main management binary that provides:
- **Registration & Authentication**: Automatic registration with the management server
- **Heartbeat System**: Periodic status reporting and health monitoring  
- **Configuration Management**: Receives and applies folder/device configurations from the server
- **HTTP Server**: Provides REST API for folder browsing (port 9090)
- **Event Reporting**: Reports sync events, errors, and status changes
- **Process Management**: Manages the Syncthing binary lifecycle

**Key Files:**
- `internal/agent/service.go` - Main service orchestration
- `internal/agent/client.go` - Management server communication
- `internal/agent/http_server.go` - Local HTTP API for folder browsing

### 2. Syncthing Binary (~26MB)
The core synchronization engine that handles:
- **File Synchronization**: Actual file transfer and synchronization
- **Device Discovery**: Finding and connecting to other Syncthing devices
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handling file conflicts during sync
- **Block-level Sync**: Efficient delta sync using blocks
- **Encryption**: Secure data transfer between devices

**Integration Points:**
- `internal/agent/syncthing.go` - Syncthing process management
- Configuration via XML files in `~/.config/syncthing/`
- REST API communication on `127.0.0.1:8384`

## Communication Flow

```
Management Server ←→ SyncTool Agent ←→ Syncthing Binary
                           ↓
                    HTTP Server (9090)
                           ↑
                    Dashboard/Browser
```

1. **Registration**: Agent registers with management server using Syncthing device ID
2. **Configuration**: Server pushes folder/device configurations to agent
3. **Management**: Agent translates configurations and manages Syncthing via REST API
4. **Monitoring**: Agent monitors Syncthing status and reports events to server
5. **Browsing**: Dashboard can browse agent folders via HTTP server (port 9090)

## Current Implementation

### Two-Binary Approach Benefits:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Management logic separate from sync engine
- **Flexibility**: Can update management layer without affecting sync
- **Proven Engine**: Leverages battle-tested Syncthing for actual synchronization
- **Remote Management**: Centralized control and monitoring
- **API Extensions**: Additional APIs (like folder browsing) without modifying Syncthing

### Configuration Flow:
1. Management server creates sync jobs with source/destination agents and paths
2. Server pushes folder configurations to relevant agents
3. Agents translate configurations into Syncthing format
4. Syncthing performs actual synchronization between devices

## Alternative Architecture: Embedded Core

### Option 1: Syncthing Library Integration
**Pros:**
- Single binary (~35-40MB)
- Reduced complexity
- Better resource efficiency
- Simpler deployment

**Cons:**
- Requires significant refactoring of Syncthing
- Loss of Syncthing's standalone capabilities
- Tighter coupling between components
- More complex development and maintenance

### Option 2: Fork and Integrate
**Pros:**
- Full control over sync engine
- Custom optimizations possible
- Single binary distribution

**Cons:**
- Must maintain fork of large codebase
- Miss upstream Syncthing improvements
- Significant development overhead
- Potential compatibility issues

## Recommendation

**Current two-binary approach is recommended** for the following reasons:

1. **Maturity**: Syncthing is a mature, well-tested synchronization engine
2. **Maintenance**: Easier to maintain separate concerns
3. **Updates**: Can benefit from upstream Syncthing improvements
4. **Development Speed**: Faster to implement management features
5. **Flexibility**: Can switch sync engines if needed
6. **Resource Usage**: Combined ~47MB is acceptable for modern systems

## Implementation Details

### Mock vs Real Syncthing
Currently, the system uses a mock Syncthing manager for development:
```go
// In service.go line 60-64
if useMock := true; useMock { // Set to false when server is ready
    syncthingManager = NewMockSyncthingManager(config.Syncthing, logger)
} else {
    syncthingManager = NewSyncthingManager(config.Syncthing, logger)
}
```

### Agent States
- **Registered**: Agent has contacted management server
- **Approved**: Administrator has approved the agent
- **Online**: Agent is running and Syncthing is operational
- **Syncing**: Actively synchronizing files

### Security Considerations
- Agents use device-specific tokens for authentication
- Syncthing provides encrypted communication between devices
- Management API secured with token-based authentication
- Local HTTP server only accessible from localhost

## Recent Improvements (August 2025)

### Dashboard UI/UX Enhancements
- **Compact Table Design**: Optimized for 500+ sync jobs with reduced row height
- **Source/Destination Model**: Clear visual separation with color-coded agent tags
- **Advanced Scheduling**: Custom time picker with hourly/daily/weekly options
- **Real-time Folder Browsing**: Live folder tree navigation on remote agents
- **Responsive Pagination**: 25/50/100/200 items per page with quick jump

### Backend Data Model Updates
- **Enhanced Folder Schema**: Added source/destination agent relationships
- **Schedule Support**: Flexible scheduling with cron-like expressions
- **Agent Relationships**: Proper foreign key constraints and preloading
- **API Response Enhancement**: Complete job data with nested agent information

### Technical Improvements
- **Database Schema V2**: 
  ```sql
  folders {
    -- Core fields
    name, sync_type, rescan_interval, max_file_size, ignore_patterns
    -- New source/destination model
    source_agent_id UUID -> agents(id)
    destination_agent_id UUID -> agents(id)  
    source_path VARCHAR(1000)
    destination_path VARCHAR(1000)
    schedule VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT 'continuous'
  }
  ```

- **Compact UI**: 150px job names, 200px paths, 80px schedules
- **Efficient Queries**: Preloaded relationships to reduce N+1 queries
- **Pagination**: Smart loading with configurable page sizes

## Future Enhancements

1. **Performance Monitoring**: Detailed sync performance metrics
2. **Bandwidth Control**: Per-job bandwidth limitations  
3. **Advanced Scheduling**: Cron expressions and timezone support
4. **Compression**: Configurable compression settings
5. **Retry Logic**: Advanced retry mechanisms for failed syncs

- **Reliability**: Proven Syncthing engine with management layer
- **Usability**: Intuitive dashboard with bulk operations
- **Monitoring**: Real-time status and performance tracking
- **Security**: Token-based authentication and encrypted transfers

This architecture provides a solid foundation for centralized file synchronization management while maintaining the reliability and efficiency of the proven Syncthing engine.
